                        <em>Hello there,</em> My name is Siramon Khiawkrue. I am currently studying for a Diploma in Web Deveopment at Tamwood College, British Columbia, Canada.
                    
                        I have a Bachelor's Degree in English and minoring in Marketing from Chiang Mai University (CMU) Thailand.
                    
                        Previously, I have worked at Bitkub, a Thailand-based cryptocurrency exchange, as a Customer Associate, where I worked on client operations such as deposits, withdrawals cryptocurrencies, and account verifications. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has drawn me in curiosity: <q><span class="span-blue"><em>how can we trade so quick on an user-friendly website and mobile application? </em></span></q>
                    
                        Because of the spark of curiosity, I came to Canada to pursue my career and study web development program. In the near future, I would like to become a good and dependable developer. I am looking forward to craft, build, and resolve technical challenges more.

                            My first project was building a personal portfolio, including, background experiences and education, using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I learned to write well-structured semantic code on Visual Studio Code to oversee a visual presentation of my content and how codes worked. In the above image, you will see the plain background and layout. I spent a week to create this project, figure out how to attach a profile, and arrange a page layout. <em>Thankfully, it went out well!</em>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            I built a company service webiste, including, video header, navigation menu, homepage, about, table content, and contact form page, using HTML and CSS for my final HTML project. This project allowed me to design the page layout, colors, contents, and so on. I had a better understanding about how content should be wrapped and how to set different possible properties between the parent element and the child elements.

                        <h5>Business Blog Exercise</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            This was one of my instructor-led practicing, which I had a chance to learn step-by-step by looking at the mock-up layout and sectioning contents. Our instructure recommended us to think inside the head about how to split the mock-up up into sections. Also, in this class, I created create navigation menu, log-in, and search button, using basic HTML and CSS.

                            Another exercise that consisted of various layouts and techniques was building a company service website. It included responsive version of the company's web page. I learned to create a gradient header, a sticky header or a fixed navigation menu on a webpage, media queries for different web browser screen size, and so on using advanced CSS.

                    <p>
                        Since it was a huge change to me from working in a customer-facing role to technology industry, I would like to apply what I have experienced as a customer service to enhance my skills in the future. I believe that my familiarity with customer feedbacks can be useful.

                    <p>
                        I would describe myself as a team player that can work well with clients, co-workers, and other people in a workplace. I respect and open for recommendations, which helps me complete tasks efficiently while creating an enjoyable environment.

                    <p>
                        To achieve the goal or successful coding, I understand that we need to manage our valueable time properly, for example, I always plan to accomplish assignments two days before the deadline. Afterwards, I will have more time to review over and over and also find a room for any improvement.
